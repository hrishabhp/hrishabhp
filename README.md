# Hi, I'm Hrishabh 👋

I'm learning Python and QA Automation and trying to improve a little every day.  
Right now, I’m mainly focusing on:

- Writing clean Python code  
- Understanding FastAPI  
- Practicing API testing with Pytest  
- Building small projects to learn backend + testing

I enjoy creating simple things that actually work, and I try to keep my code easy to understand.

### 🔧 Skills I'm working with
- Python  
- FastAPI (beginner level)  
- Pytest  
- API Testing  
- Git & GitHub  
- VS Code / PyCharm

### 📌 Projects

#### **Aadhaar & PAN Validation API**
A small FastAPI project where I validate Aadhaar and PAN numbers and write test cases using Pytest.  
It helped me understand API structure, validation logic, and automated testing.
